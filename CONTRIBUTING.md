## Coding Style 

There is a .editorconfig and a eclipse_formatting_profile.xml

What sticks out is that end of line is CRLF ('\r\n') for this Project.

This means that if you're on Linux ('\n'), you have to configure git to handle this
correctly so that you have the correct EOL in your working directory,
and the EOL is also correct in the repository itself.
